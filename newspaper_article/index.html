        VENICE — Just after midday, an unusual gondola journey caused considerable commotion along the canal road. Onboard were two striking figures: one, an elf with iron vine markings—unknown to most; the other, a red-haired child, masked in polished silver and exuding quiet authority. Witnesses say a strange resonance rippled through the water. “I’ve only ever felt that signal twice,” one gondolier recalled. “Once for the arrival of the Veronese family head. And now this.”

        The procession soon drew offers from gondola vendors and noble households alike. But the boy—described as poised and unfailingly courteous—declined each with a soft-spoken, “No, thank you. Go on.”

        Insiders now speculate on the pair’s identities. The child’s bearing and appearance have sparked whispers of a connection to Selene or Silvanus. Meanwhile, the elf—ash-blonde, golden-eyed—is believed to be a rare hybrid of both Eastern and Western lineages. Rumors range from the diplomatic to the fantastical: a visiting dignitary, a hidden heir, or even a figure from estate legend. Official inquiries have been filed with the Estate Council. As of publication, no formal response has been issued.
