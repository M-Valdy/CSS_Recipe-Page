      <p id="tribute-info" aria-label="Info about St. Augustine">
        Born in 354 AD in Roman North Africa, Saint Augustine lived a life of philosophical questioning,
        sin, and spiritual searching before his dramatic conversion to Christianity at the age of 31—due
        in large part to the prayers and tears of his devout mother, Saint Monica. A former student of Saint Ambrose, Bishop of
        Milan, Augustine would go on to become the Bishop of Hippo and one of the most influential, if not
        the most influential, theologians in Western Christianity. He left behind timeless works like
        <em>Confessions</em> and <em>The City of God</em>, shaping generations of Catholic theologians,
        popes, and church councils. His journey from restlessness to divine purpose continues to inspire
        believers, seekers, and scholars to this day.

          <h2>354 AD – Early Turmoil in Thagaste</h2>
          <p>
            Born in Roman North Africa to Monica (a devout Christian) and Patricius (a pagan who converted on his deathbed), Augustine’s
            early life was marked by spiritual tension. He famously stole a pear—not from hunger, but for
            the thrill—later realizing he sinned for sin’s sake.

          <h2>370s – Hedonism and Philosophical Frustration</h2>
          <p>
            While studying in Carthage, he embraced sensual pleasure and joined the Manichaeans—a dualistic religion.
            Though brilliant, he remained spiritually unsatisfied. Monica never stopped praying for him.

        <section class="event">
          <h2>Early 380s – "Grant Me Chastity—But Not Yet"</h2>
          <p>
            As a father to Adeodatus and partner to a long-term lover, Augustine prayed for chastity while
            still clinging to worldly desire. He was torn: yearning for wisdom, resisting surrender.

        <section class="event">
          <h2>383–384 – Milan & Ambrose</h2>
          <p>
            In Milan, Augustine met Bishop Ambrose, whose rhetorical brilliance impressed him. Monica, now living with him,
            intensified her prayers. Slowly, her son’s heart began to change.
          </p>

        <section class="event">
          <h2>384–385 – Separation and Internal Grief</h2>
          <p>
            Augustine sent away his long-term partner—the mother of Adeodatus—to pursue a political marriage with a young noble girl,
            who was not yet of marriageable age. In the waiting period, he took another mistress, worsening
            his inner torment. He later wrote that his heart was “torn and bleeding.”

        <section class="event">
          <h2>386 – Garden of Tears</h2>
          <p>
            In anguish, Augustine heard a childlike voice say: “Take up and read.” He opened the Bible to Romans
            13:13–14 and found the call to cast off sin. That moment marked his true awakening.
          </p>

        <section class="event">
          <h2>387 – Baptism of Augustine and Death of Monica</h2>
          <p>
            On Easter Vigil, Augustine was baptized by Ambrose, alongside Adeodatus and his friend Alypius.
            Shortly after, Monica died peacefully in Ostia, unable to return to Africa before her death, saying her life’s mission—his salvation—was complete.
            Augustine wept like a child.

        </section>

        <section class="event">
          <h2>388 – Death of Adeodatus</h2>
          <p>
            Back in North Africa, Augustine’s brilliant son Adeodatus died as a teenager. Augustine rarely
            spoke of it after, but his writings reflect a deep shift from ambition to humility.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="event">
          <h2>Post-Baptism – A Radical New Life</h2>
          <p>
            Augustine renounced his teaching career and formed a monastic community in Tagaste.
            He began writing, praying, and living in simplicity with like-minded men.

        <section class="event">
          <h2>391–430 – Bishop & Theologian</h2>
          <p class="no-border">
            Ordained in 391 and appointed Bishop of Hippo in 395, Augustine spent the rest of his life preaching,
            writing, debating heresies, and building the theological foundations of the Church. His “second
            conversion” was one of surrender—from brilliant rhetorician to humble shepherd.
