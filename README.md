# CSS_Recipe-Page

## NOTE: I am officially done with most of the projects in my CSS module, the other projects are located in other repositories for their own recipe pages. Animation will have its own recipe page since the CSS would take a lot of effort

This repository contains all of the personal projects that I did in FreeCodeCamp in HTML and CSS. This repository is called the recipe page because this is where I cook (Part 2). Other recipes (Python, Javascript, etc.) will come in later through an entirely different repository. To be perfectly honest, I had a lot of fun with some of these projects as I ended up using a fantasy concept for a lot of them. Especially since I like writing stories in my spare time.

## Projects
