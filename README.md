# CSS_Recipe-Page
This repository contains all of the personal projects that I did in FreeCodeCamp in HTML and CSS. This repository is called the recipe page because this is where I cook (Part 2). Other recipes (Python, Javascript, etc. ) will come in later through an entirely different repository.

## Projects

### 1. Cafe Menu
A cafe menu made with basic html and CSS. This is the first project I have used for CSS, so its probably not using best practices or anything 

- **Live site**: [View thing here](https://m-valdy.github.io/CSS_Recipe-Page/cafe_menu.html)
