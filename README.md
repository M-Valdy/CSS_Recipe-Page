# CSS_Recipe-Page
This repository contains all of the personal projects that I did in FreeCodeCamp in HTML and CSS. This repository is called the recipe page because this is where I cook (Part 2). Other recipes (Python, Javascript, etc. ) will come in later through an entirely different repository.
