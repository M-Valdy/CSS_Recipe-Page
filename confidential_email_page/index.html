    <p>To <span class="blurred">Lavinia</span>,</p>

<p>This is your <span class="blurred">grandfather-in-law</span> speaking. I have received your letter and would like to congratulate you on your achievement.</p>

<p>It is rare for someone so young to succeed in the difficult task of <span class="blurred">binding not one, but all four elemental kings of Italy to your command</span>. I especially commend you for your ingenious binding of <span>Alessandro</span>. Never in my <span class="blurred">two thousand plus</span> years of life would I have ever thought of doing such a thing.</p>

<p>I also admire your commitment to <span class="blurred">secrecy</span>. Most would treat a feat like this as an opportunity to boast. But discretion, especially in matters of power, is what <span class="blurred">keeps the elementals calmâ€”and</span> keeps you safe.</p>

<p>Let me know if anything is missing.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/><span class="blurred signature">Samuel</span></p>
