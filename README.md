# CSS_Recipe-Page
This repository contains all of the personal projects that I did in FreeCodeCamp in HTML and CSS. This repository is called the recipe page because this is where I cook (Part 2). Other recipes (Python, Javascript, etc. ) will come in later through an entirely different repository.

## Projects

### 1. ☕️ Cafe Menu
A cafe menu made with basic HTML and CSS. This is the first project I have used for CSS, so its probably not using best practices or anything 

- **Live site**: [View Cafe Menu](https://m-valdy.github.io/CSS_Recipe-Page/cafe_menu/index.html)
- **Folder**: `cafe_menu`
- **Tools**: HTML5 and CSS

### 2. Business Card
A business card made with basic HTML and CSS. I might actually use this in the future somehow. Also all of the social media info in this thing is correct.

- **Live site**: [View Business Card](https://m-valdy.github.io/CSS_Recipe-Page/business_card/index.html)
- **Folder**: `business_card`
- **Tools**: HTML5 and CSS
